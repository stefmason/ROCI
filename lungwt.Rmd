### Loading Data
```{r load data}
#Load demographic data for gender
demo <- read_excel("~/Documents/ROCIanalysis/ROCI_101918.xlsx", sheet = "Outcomes", range = cell_cols(1:4), col_types = c("numeric", "skip", "skip", "numeric"))

#Load imaging/weight data and merge
weights <- read_excel("~/Documents/ROCIanalysis/ROCI_101918.xlsx", sheet = "LungWt", range = cell_cols(1:12)) %>% 
  gather(side, weight, r_lung_wt:l_lung_wt) %>%
  mutate(side = ifelse(side == "r_lung_wt", "right", "left"), side_total = ifelse(side == "right", quad1+quad3, quad2+quad4)) %>%
  filter(wi_24h == 1) %>%
  left_join(., demo, by = "Subject_ID") %>% 
  mutate(Male = as.factor(Male))

```

## Analysis
### Spearman
<p>Our Spearman is much lower than that reported in the RALE study, however they had much lower avg lung weights (median 797g). They reported rho = 0.59 for all explants and rho = 0.73 for the heavy subset. 
```{r spearman correlation}
cor.test(weights$side_total, weights$weight, method = "spearman")

rale_weights <- weights %>% filter(weight > 797)
cor.test(rale_weights$side_total, rale_weights$weight, method = "spearman")
```

### Linear regression
<p>Based on the residual diagnostics, it is reasonable to use linear regression despite the data being non-normal (below). This allows us to control for the confounders of height and gender on lung weight. 
```{r linear regression}
weights %>% ggplot(aes(side_total, weight, color = side)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")

wt <- lm(weight ~ side_total+height+Male, data = weights)
summary(wt)

#check normality of errors
ols_plot_resid_qq(wt)
ols_test_correlation(wt)
```

## Testing for normality
<p> The data are non-normal.
```{r normality test}
shapiro.test(weights$weight)
weights %>% ggplot(aes(weight)) + geom_histogram()
```
