```{r set-up, message=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(irr)
library(psych)
```
```{r import IRR data, message=FALSE}
#import the Excel sheet with the IRR data
ROCI_IRR <- read_excel("~/Documents/ROCIanalysis/ROCI_101918.xlsx", sheet = "IRR_2", col_types = c("numeric", "text", "numeric", "date", "text", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric"))
#create a dataframe of the CXR and the rating assigned by each reviewer
ROCI_IRR <- mutate(ROCI_IRR, cxr_id = paste(Subject_ID, CXR_time, sep=""))
first <- filter(ROCI_IRR, Reviewer == 0) %>% select(cxr_id, Total)
second <- filter(ROCI_IRR, Reviewer == 1) %>% select(cxr_id, Total)
colnames(first) <- c("ID", "Rev1")
colnames(second) <- c("ID", "Rev2")
ratings <- merge(first, second)
rm(first, second)
```
Calculating an ICC (two-way, consistency, with 95% confidence):
```{r ICC with IRR package}
irr::icc(ratings[c(2,3)], model="t", type="c", unit="s", r0=0, conf.level=0.95)
```
```{r ICC w psych package}
psych::ICC(ratings[c(2,3)], missing=TRUE, alpha=0.05)
```

<br>And a Cohen's kappa (with squared weights):
```{r kappa}
kappa2(ratings[c(2,3)], "squared")
#doesn't kappa assume nominal data??
```
<br>Scatterplot of agreement:
```{r scatterplot}
scatter <-ggplot(ratings, aes(Rev1, Rev2)) + geom_point(size=2) + ggtitle("Scatterplot of Agreement between Reviewers") + xlab("Reviewer 1 score") + ylab("Reviewer 2 score")
scatter + geom_abline(slope=1, size=0.5, color="blue") + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,16,2)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,16,2))
```
<br>A Bland-Altman plot:
```{r BA plot}
#Generate the differences and averages for plot
ratings <- mutate(ratings, diff = (Rev1 - Rev2), avg = ((Rev1 + Rev2) / 2))
#Generate plot
BAplot <- ggplot(ratings, aes(avg, diff)) + geom_point(size=2) + ggtitle("Bland-Altman Plot of Inter-rater Reliability") + xlab("Average") + ylab("Difference")
BAplot + geom_hline(yintercept=mean(ratings$diff), color="blue", size=0.5) + geom_hline(yintercept=mean(ratings$diff) - 1.96*sd(ratings$diff), color="red", size=0.5) + geom_hline(yintercept=mean(ratings$diff) + 1.96*sd(ratings$diff), color="red", size=0.5)
```
